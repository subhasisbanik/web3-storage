## Description

This project utilizes the Javascript methods prepared by the web3-storage(https://web3.storage/docs/) team and prepares a REST layer on top of it. This would not only provide the capability of the layer to be interactive with any RESTful framework like Java/Python, but also allow middlewares to integrate with the same for seamless access to storage provided by web3-storage.
